The Future of Productivity.

## What is XCR?

XCR is an open-source Electron-based desktop application designed to help you take control of your workflow. It expands on many of the core ideas created from projects like [RC2](https://github.com/beachweak/RC2) and borrows ideas from [R2K](https://github.com/beachweak/R2K).

XCR includes support for custom widgets designed by users with an automatic import function, a custom app creation tool and a plethora of profile customisation features. XCR doesn't require an internet connection either, since it runs on Electron, making it your perfect companion for on-the-go productivity.

## FAQ

The FAQ section, along with a lot of other documentation has been moved to the XCR docs, located at [https://beachweak.github.io/XCR](https://beachweak.github.io/XCR). Please read here for download information, frequently asked questions, developer guidance and more.

## Download

I encourage you to clone XCR's repository and install Electron into it. This allows for custom widget creation and source code editing.

For a user's copy, please download one of the three binaries [here](https://github.com/beachweak/XCR/releases).

Linux support will be available as of v1.2.0.
